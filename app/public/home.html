        <h4>
            <p>This application includes a survey that helps serious mountain bikers find their perfect riding buddy.</p>
            <p>It's hard to find a riding buddy that has the same riding philosophy, let alone a similar skill. Forget the push and pull of trying to get everyone down the mountain while sacrificing your fun-factor. Let this survey narrow down those who
                have the same riding style, and want to enjoy the ride in the same way.
            </p>
            <p>Fill out the survey and the behind-the-scenes "Riding-Mojo-Assessor" will compare and find your best riding buddy matches.
            </p>
